Number Guessing Game

This Python code implements a simple number guessing game using the PySimpleGUI library. The user has the opportunity to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 20. The game provides visual feedback (color change) for correct and incorrect guesses, along with retry and "About" functionality.

**Features:**

* Randomly generates a number between 0 and 20.
* Displays a grid of buttons for user input.
* Provides visual feedback on guesses (green for correct, red for incorrect).
* Offers an "About" button with game information.
* Allows restarts through a "Retry" button.
* Employs PySimpleGUI for a user-friendly graphical interface.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone or download the repository containing this code.
2. Install the required library: `pip install PySimpleGUI`
3. Run the script: `python number_guessing_game.py` (replace with the actual filename)
4. Interact with the game window to guess the number or learn more about the game using the "About" button.

**Dependencies:**

* PySimpleGUI (https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
